# New Vehicle Sales Forecast in Canada

The automotive industry is a substantial contributor to the global economy, and accurate forecasting of new motor vehicle sales is fundamental for manufacturers, dealerships, and other stakeholders to make informed business decisions. The purpose of this project is to create a prediction model that accurately predicts new car sales using statistical methodologies and machine learning algorithms. Seasonal demands, monthly gas prices, interest rates, unemployment rates, and natural disasters can gravely impact the sales if companies are not aware of the trends and hence prepared for them. Sales forecasting will therefore help companies anticipate the market trends and arrange their catalogue, calculate the revenue, as well as decide on new investments. Another key advantage would be to have a predetermined internal target in accordance with the data.

## Dataset
The dataset of new motor vehicles sales in Canada from Jan 2000 - Dec 2022 was collected. Other dependecies like mean temperature, precipitation, ground frost days, unemployment rate, employment rate, gdp, gdp - motor industry, gas prices and cpi of entire Canada was also collected. Since the vehicle sales dataset was monthly frequency, we had to ensure that the rest of the dependencies were also in monthly frequency from the same range.

The dataset was collected from:

## Model Development
The project consisted of 5 models. Multivariate Linear Regression Model, two statistical models: ARIMA & SARIMA and two machine learning models: Decision Tree & Random Forest Regressor.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Keras 2.4.3 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.4.1 or higher
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- plotly

- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Visual Studio Code (or any preferred text editor)

## Results
The provided code demonstrates various techniques to assess and transform time series data for forecasting new vehicle sales. A fully functional interactive dashboard was created and deployed based on these machine learning models.
